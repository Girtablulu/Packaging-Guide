## Switching to the unstable repo

Would you like to help Solus in package maintaining you must switch first to the unstable repo. 

IMPORTANT:
Please be aware, you must check the topic on IRC `#Solus-Dev` before you are updating your system if any breaking updates are going on! 

To switch to the unstable repo, run:

```bash
sudo eopkg ar Solus https://mirrors.rit.edu/solus/packages/unstable/eopkg-index.xml.xz
```
